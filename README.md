# www.concept-academy.co.il landing pages

## Information
HTML, Responsive design.
These landing pages are used by AdWords, it is therefore vital that no folder & file names are changed, as this would break the URL's.
All these pages are located under the /lnd folder on the server, which hosts the main site (www.concept-academy.co.il) using Drupal. These pages do not use any CMS, they are just HTML pages.

## Style
Mobile rendering is the entire purpose of doing the responsive design. 
If it isn't visble in mobile, then it needs to be changed.
IE 7, 8, 9 support essential.
